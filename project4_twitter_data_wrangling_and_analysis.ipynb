    "For this report, I wrangled WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy data insights and visualizations of the dog rating twitter feed. \n",

    "The twitter data will be enhanced with information of likely breed of the dog being rated, based on images available in the tweets. This data originates from a neural network image prediction data set of types of dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, I createe a solid and clean master dataset. Possible questions to ask:\n",
